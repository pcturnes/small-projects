# Small Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects that I work on for university or out of personal interest.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes its own detailed README.

## 🗂️ Project List

- **Iris Classification KNN**  
  A full machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset, applying K-Nearest Neighbors to classify flower species and evaluating model performance with confidence intervals and cross-validation. Project made out of personal interest

- **Cluster–Voronoi Visualization**  
  A geometric exploration of how k-NN (k=1) decision boundaries relate to Voronoi diagrams, using a wine dataset and high-resolution visualizations. Project made out of personal interest


- **Optimization Using Pyomo**  
  A linear optimization model for profit maximization across advertising channels, implemented with Pyomo and solved using GLPK. This project was done for homework 1 of "Optimization for large-scale data"

- **API-WorldBank**
