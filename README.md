# Small Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects that I work on for university or out of personal interest.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes its own detailed README.

## 🗂️ Project List

- **Iris Classification KNN**  
  A full machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset, applying K-Nearest Neighbors to classify flower species and evaluating model performance with confidence intervals and cross-validation.

- **Cluster–Voronoi Visualization**  
  A geometric exploration of how k-NN (k=1) decision boundaries relate to Voronoi diagrams, using a wine dataset and high-resolution visualizations.

- **Optimization Using Pyomo**  
  A linear optimization model for profit maximization across advertising channels, implemented with Pyomo and solved using GLPK.

- **API-WorldBank**  
  A master project to test APIs. We tested different endpoints from the World Bank to obtain some data. We structured the result json file to get it in a specified structure.

- **API-Creation**  
  A master project from the course "Internet content distribution". The objective of this lab is to create a client-server paradigm where the client asks the server for some data via API requests. The endpoints were manually created.

More projects will be added over time.
