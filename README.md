# Small Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects that I work on for university or out of personal interest.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes its own detailed README.

## 🗂️ Project List

- **Iris Classification KNN**  
  A full machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset, applying K-Nearest Neighbors to classify flower species and evaluating model performance with confidence intervals and cross-validation.  
  Project made out of personal interest.

- **Cluster–Voronoi Visualization**  
  A geometric exploration of how k-NN (k=1) decision boundaries relate to Voronoi diagrams, using a wine dataset and high-resolution visualizations.  
  Project made out of personal interest.

- **Optimization Using Pyomo**  
  A linear optimization model for profit maximization across advertising channels, implemented with Pyomo and solved using GLPK.  
  This project was done for homework 1 of *Optimization for Large-Scale Data*.

- **API-WorldBank**  
  A Python client that queries the World Bank's API, focusing on data retrieval, dynamic URL construction for specific indicators and countries, and response parsing for economic analysis.  
  This project was lab 1 of the course *Internet Contents Distribution*.

- **API-Creation**  
  A foundational project implementing a custom HTTP API server in Python using `http.server`, demonstrating data handling, query filtering, and authentication with access tokens.  
  This project was lab 2 of the course *Internet Contents Distribution*.

- **BigBasket-Analysis**  
  A basic analysis of a database collecting products, prices, and ratings from an Indian supermarket.  
  The goal is to predict product ratings using linear regression.

- **PCA – World Happiness Index**  
  An exploratory analysis applying Principal Component Analysis to the World Happiness dataset.  
  Two approaches are implemented: a manual PCA built from first principles and a PCA using the scikit-learn library.  
  Both methods yield equivalent results, confirming the correctness of the implementation.  
  For practical use and computational efficiency, the scikit-learn approach is recommended.

- **Hospital Resource Optimization**  
  A Python-based linear and integer optimization model for multi-period hospital planning, focusing on resource allocation across departments and shifts using Pyomo.  
  Includes analysis of primal, integer, and dual formulations to study efficiency and integrality gaps.
